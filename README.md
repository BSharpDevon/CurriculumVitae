## About Me  
Hi! I'm Beth Sharp, a journalist-turned-comms specialist who swapped being landlocked for seaside life when I moved to Devon. Five years ago, I left journalism for communications and reignited my passion for tech with a digital transformation team.

When my daughter arrived two years ago, my priorities shifted. I decided spending 40-plus hours a week doing something I’m good at but didn’t enjoy wasn’t enough for me or my family. Inspired by a Code First Girls alumna and friend, I dove into coding and discovered my passion ran deeper than I imagined.

I spent two hours a night, four nights a week attending classes, plus an extra 20 hours a week on homework for six months. While juggling a full-time job with extended hours and being a mum, I achieved a Full-Stack Nanodegree with Code First Girls (Distinction, 92%) and a Master’s in Cyber Security (Merit, 87%). Managing my time, forward planning my week and organising myself and my family made this possible - and giving up TV and social media doom scrolling!

Every Tuesday, I virtually meet two fellow “girl-coders” to push our final-project app forward—just for fun. We’ve already sketched out our next two builds. It’s become a hobby, letting me enjoy complex problem-solving and benefit from pair-programming.

My dream employer values continuous learning and progression, invests in both its own and its employees’ futures, and supports underrepresented groups. I bring commitment, camaraderie, and a sense of humour to every team.

Our family motto is “it’s nice to be nice.” Compassion, empathy and treating everyone as I’d like to be treated have helped me build work families and lifelong friendships across walks of life.

## Skills  
**Communication:** 

Communication, both written and spoken, has always been a highly important part of my career. I’m well practised at communicating highly complex issues and topics clearly (such as local planning issues to court proceedings) in everything from press releases and planning with communication plans, ensuring anyone can understand what I’m trying to get across in a jargon-less way. This is a skill that has served me well while undertaking my full-stack degree and cyber security, where I have worked with others to understand and explain coding concepts.

Building relationships both within and outside my organisation when working on multi-million-pound projects has also been pivotal. I have achieved these relationship by staying in touch with people, regularly with meetings booked three months in advance, setting clear expectations and goals with a forward plan and understanding the brief, by asking questions. Treating people the way I’d like to be treated has always been key.

---

**Problem solving:**

One of the things that made me fall in love with coding was the incredible satisfaction of solving a problem. It taught me how determined I’d become, sometimes finding it hard to switch off, or even to stop, until I’d figured out what was stopping my code from working. There’s a particular thrill (and occasional amusement) when you discover it was something as small as a rogue comma. Coding also showed me the value of stepping back to break down a problem: mapping out a diagram, sketching each step, and planning my solution. It reinforced the importance of test-driven development, making sure something works before moving on to the next task.

Problem solving is a core part of my current role in local government. I’m constantly challenged to anticipate new issues, whether preparing crisis communications plans for upcoming meetings or drafting protocols for Operation London Bridge and to develop cross-departmental strategies that boost productivity and speed up our response. By having clear plans in place, it helps me to reduce workplace stress for myself and my team, because everyone knows exactly what to do and is ready to act.

**Love of learning**

I didn’t have a privileged upbringing, and didn’t read a full book until I was 15 years old. I was raised on a council estate near Birmingham in the UK. Since then my thirst for knowledge has grown tenfold. I feel like anyone can teach themselves anything if they are determined enough. I love learning and teaching myself to do it - whether it’s using a sewing machine to take up my curtains, or learning about child psychology and development to help my daughter as she grows.

I just never get bored of learning about ways to improve not just my own quality of life through education, but also of the important people around me. We live in an age where everything is at our fingertips, and I feel so privileged that I am now able to say that I have three degree-level qualifications - four if you count the master’s. I enjoy the process of learning something new as well as the result and this has in turn influenced my daughter and partner to enjoy gardening and painting as you do it, not just to get results.

**In 2025 my learning goals include:**

- Refresh training: assertiveness and conflict resolution.
- Learn a new coding language: C#.
- Practice with React and JavaScript.
- Improve my video and editing skills.
- Get a drone license.

**Teamwork** 

A problem solved is a problem halved. I have been able to work with some brilliant high-achieving teams during my career, those who pulled me through when my workload was high, kept up my morale with shared experience and camaraderie, and helped me to grow. It has shaped my core values and influenced my belief that finding a good job isn’t just about the role itself but also about whether the culture is the right fit.

During my career I have found that when recruiting is done well, whether I was a new employee or on the interview board, it helps in so many ways. Great teamwork improves collaboration with diverse views, allowing faster brainstorming and solutions that not everyone would suggest. I’m passionate about supporting under-represented groups, especially women, working mothers, and those with disabilities. I’ve had the privilege of being part of the selection process and then mentoring several university graduates as part of a local government scheme, helping to create a diverse team that grew from two to ten members in three years. The experience improved my communication and effectiveness, building lasting relationships with colleagues of different ages and backgrounds and reinforcing my belief that helping others helps yourself. My work on this programme was also recognised by the chief executive and leadership team.

The team now works together to make large, multi-million-pound projects, such as like coastal sea defences, more manageable. This collaboration has reduced work-related stress, and our tight-knit culture has made the team resilient: we support each other through delays, maintain momentum, and prevent burnout, further improving workplace culture. Being around like-minded people who are passionate about learning, progression, and attention to detail has been infectious and ideal for picking up new skills quickly, such as mastering software together. The accountability has also acted as a motivator; having autonomy in our work encourages everyone to strive harder for the team - we are in it together, and that boosts morale.
